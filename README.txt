Here are all of the files/code used to score the 2015/2016 flu forecasting challenge submissions.
I've outlined the dependency structures below and how the files are used below. Please let me know
if you have any questions or suggestions to improve the code!



FOLDERS:

compare plots - folder to store plots comparing forecasts between teams

forecast_base - folder storing R code used in main Process_Submission file

forecast_submissions - folder to store submissions to be scored. Must be structured in the same manner as 
	"templates" folder

team plots - folder to store plots of team forecasts with approximated confidence bands

team score sheets - folder to store CSV files of team specific scores

templates - folder storing null templates of scores sheets. Used to verify structure of forecast submissions


FILES: 

15-16_ILINet_Flu.csv - ILINet data from the season as of Week 28

flu_scores_2015-16_share.Rproj - R project file

flu_targets - Targets imported into Process_Submission.R to score the forecasts. Seasonal targets were handcoded
		based on ILINet data, weekly targets were copied and pasted from weekly_flu_targets.csv

Process_Submission.R - main file to score submissions and generate plots of forecasts and scores
	
	DEPENDENCIES:
	
	import_forecast.R - import forecast CSV files from "forecast_submissions" folder and templates
			 	from "templates" folder

	import_forecast_data.R - convert forecasts from lists to single data frame

	plot_forecasts_ggplot.R - graph individual forecasts with approximate confidence bands and comparitive
					plots betweeen teams

	plot_scores_flu_2015-16.R - plot individual forecast scores and comparitive scores between forecasts 

	three_bin_score.R - generate log score based on the three bin scoring system

	verify_forecasts.R - verify forecasts submitted. Normalize probabilities if sum to between 0.9 and 1.1,
				otherwise generate error and set to missing.

weekly_flu_targets.csv - weekly targets for now/nearcasting generated from weekly_targets.R

weekly_targets.R - generates weekly targets to score 1-4 week ahead forecasts.


NOTES:
Your forecasts to be scored must be structured in the same manner as the "templates" folder. If probabilities
in a particular column do not sum to between 0.9 and 1.1 then the probabilities in that row will be set to NA. 
As the verify_forecasts file runs it will output the number of columns that have been normalized in a particular
submission and also generate warnings for any missing values.
